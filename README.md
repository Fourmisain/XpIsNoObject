'Too expensive?' Do you KNOW how much XP I have? I will not be treated like this! A woman of my stature works hard for her XP, and she must be able to spend it.

Made with [this template thingy](https://github.com/architectury/archloom-example-mod).
With some trivial mixins 'inspired' by [this mod](https://github.com/Xtreme533/Forging-Beyond).

# TODO

- [x] It works
- [x] Rename the mod internals to something less generic
- [x] Set XP cap to max int or something
- [ ] Change mixins.json to fix resource collision
- [ ] Figure out how to build for Fabric.
- [ ] Distribute for both Fabric and Forge.
- [ ] I dunno, beg for money?
